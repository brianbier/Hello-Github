# hello_world
My first repository

Hi Everyone!

Brian Here, This is my first repository and so far I am happy this is happening. My next step is to learn ruby the hardway and then create my own application. I love working out and eating organic food. For some reason food outside the U.S. taste better. Thats just my opinion. I've jumped off a moving car onces going at 1 mph!!

Learning about branches and how to create them and merge.
